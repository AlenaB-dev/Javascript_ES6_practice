    <h1>JS engine phases</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Compilation. Create activation Object with all variables</li>
      <li>Execution. Execute code line by line</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Variable lifecycle phases</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Declaration. Register in the corresponding scope.</li>
      <li>
        Initialization. Allocate memory for the variable. Variable declared with
        "var" will get automatic value "undefined".
      </li>
      <li>Assigment. Assign value to all initialized variable.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Var lifecycle</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Compilation phase include declaratiob and initialization. Variable is
        "initialized" and value is "undefined"
      </li>
      <li>
        Execution phase incule assigment. Variable is "assigned" and has "value"
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Undeclared variable lifesysle</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Compilation phase - nothing will happened.</li>
      <li>
        Execution phase will include all three phases, 1. Declaration 2>
        Initialization 3. Assigment, together. Variable is "declared" in the
        global scope, "initialized", "assigned" and value is "value".
      </li>
      <p>*this can happen only without using "use strict" mode.</p>
    </ul>
    <h3>Let lifecycle</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Compilation phase. Declaration - temporal dead zone (TDZ) - variable is
        "declared" but "uninitialized".
      </li>
      <li>
        Execution phase. Initialization - "initialized" with "indefined".
        Assigment - variable is "assigned" and has "value".
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Const lifecycle</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Declaration phase. Temporal dead zone (TDZ) - variable is "declared" but
        "uninitialized".
      </li>
      <li>
        Execution phase. Initialization and Assigment - variable is
        "initialized", "assigned" and has "value".
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      *TDZ - special interval between start of the code execution until
      declaration using variables let or const. Accessing variable in the
      Temporal dead zone will lead to the following error - RefernceError:
      Variable is not defined.
    </p>
    <h3>Function lifecycle</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Compilation phase. Declaration, Initialization and Assigment all in one
        stage. Variable is "declared", "initialized", "assigned" and value is
        "value"
      </li>
      <li>Execution phase - variable is ready to use.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>What is hoisting?</h3>
    <p>
      Hoisting is a term that describes proces of compilation and execution
      phases.
